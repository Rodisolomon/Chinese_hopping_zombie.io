            THE ORIGIN OF JIANGSHI
        </h1>
        <p class = "line" style = 'font-style: italic'>
            “The Jiangshi (Mandarin), or goeng si (Cantonese) is a term used to describe reanimated stiff corpses that hop around attacking people to absorb their yang energy and suck out their life essense-chi.” (Katarzyna, 2021, P145.) 
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            Many words in this quotation may seem confusing: what are yang and chi? How can a dead corpse be reanimated? What IS a Jiangshi?
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            Firstly appearing in novels of the Qing Dynasty, Hopping Zombie/Jiangshi (殭屍) is a figure closely associated with the traditional Taosim and Chinese notion of the afterlife and human souls, which have a much longer age tracing back to the earliest history of Chinese civilization. All those terms mentioned above are part of this traditional belief system, and Jiangshi itself is an adapted product based on it. In the following sections, I will start from the very beginning of Chinese civilization, introduce the developed belief of afterlife and human souls, discuss Jiangshi and its relation with those beliefs, and other possible origins of it.

            Human Souls: Hun and P’o
        </h2>
        <p class = "line">
            Chinese started the imagination of the afterlife thousand years ago. Starting from the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 B.C.), people began to worship the spirits of their ancestors through rituals, and there is a clear record that words such as “ghost (鬼)” had already appeared in bone inscriptions used in rituals (Johnson, 1995.)

            The T-shape silk painting (from wikipedia.)
        </p>
        <br>
        <img class = "img" src = imgs/T.png>
        <p class = "line">
            Since Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), clearer and more complete rules about ceremonies happening in important events were developed, resulting in a complicated system of rituals called chou-li (周禮.) One of the most important events is the death of people. 
            An particular ritual called fu (復) is usually performed as the first of a series of rituals for a newly dead. In fu, a summoner will face the north and call the name of the death out loudly. People believe that by doing so, the hun-soul of the death will return to his body. 
            In a famous excavated tomb built during Han dynasty called Ma-wang-dui (馬王堆漢墓), a T-shape silk painting is discovered, and there are clear depictions of summoners in this painting (in the white circle.)

            Another thing people noticed from the painting is that Chinese living in Han dynasty had also developed a relatively complete idea of the afterworld: the painting also describes the scene of the underworld, the rising spirit of the dead, and the heaven.
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            As mentioned above, fu is a ritual summoning the hun-soul of the dead, which leads to an important concept in the ancient Chinese notion developed during the second century B.C: the duality in the human soul which can be separated into hun-sould and p’o-soul. 
            A line in Li-Chi (禮記) can explain the difference between them: “The breath-soul (hun-chi魂氣) returns to heaven; the bodily soul(hsing-p’o形魄) returns to earth.”(Yu, 2016, P374)
        </p>
        <p class = "line"> 
            Briefly speaking, there’re two parts of life: a bodily part relying on food and water, and a spiritual part depending on an invisible heavenly force called "chi (氣)" - also considered as the “source of life”(Yu, 2016, P376.) Different parts of human soul govern different parts of human life: while p’o is in charge of the bodily part, hun governs the spiritual part, and will be closer to heaven.
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            This duality between human life and souls is also related to the traditional Taoist idea of Yin and Yang (陰 陽): hun represents the Yang/positive/masculine part of human life, while p’o represents the Yin/negative/feminine part of it. In fact, stuffs mentioned above - afterworld, duality of soul, chi, etc. - are all closely related to Taoism, thus the idea of Jiangshi can even be considered as an adapted product based on the Taoist idea.
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            After the death of human beings, two souls will leave the body and separate. P’o which is closely associated with the body will return to earth when the dead is buried. Hun, on the other hand, is much freer to move around, and will usually return to the afterworld - either hell or heaven. This also explains why it is hun but not p'o which is summoned in fu.

        <img class = "img" src = imgs/yinyang.png>
        <p class = "line">
            To conclude, ancient Chinese emphasize the death of human beings, and believe in the existance of afterlife, thus develop a complicated ritual system. They also believe in the dualistic conception of human soul, and Taoist idea of Yin-Yang also comes into play: comparing to p'o governing human body, hun is more heavenly and masculine (Yang), governs the spirit of human, and relates to "chi", the origin of life.
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            In next section about the origin, cause, kind, and characteristics of Jiangshi, word such as hun, p’o, chi will repeatedly appear, showing that those notions developed in the earliest time of Chinese civilization are preserved until Qing dynasty - a thousand years later.
