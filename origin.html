            THE ORIGIN OF JIANGSHI
        </h1>
        <p class = "line" style = 'font-style: italic'>
            “The Jiangshi (Mandarin), or goeng si (Cantonese) is a term used to describe reanimated stiff corpses that hop around attacking people to absorb their yang energy and suck out their life essense-chi.” (Katarzyna, 2021, P145.) 
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            Many words in this quotation may seem confusing: what are yang and chi? How can a dead corpse be reanimated? What IS a Jiangshi?
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            Firstly appearing in novels of the Qing Dynasty, Hopping Zombie/Jiangshi (殭屍) is a figure closely associated with the traditional Taosim and Chinese notion of the afterlife and human souls, which have a much longer age tracing back to the earliest history of Chinese civilization. All those terms mentioned above are part of this traditional belief system, and Jiangshi itself is an adapted product based on it. In the following sections, I will start from the very beginning of Chinese civilization, introduce the developed belief of afterlife and human souls, discuss Jiangshi and its relation with those beliefs, and other possible origins of it.

            Human Souls: Hun and P’o
        </h2>
        <p class = "line">
            Chinese started the imagination of the afterlife thousand years ago. Starting from the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 B.C.), people began to worship the spirits of their ancestors through rituals, and there is a clear record that words such as “ghost (鬼)” had already appeared in bone inscriptions used in rituals (Johnson, 1995.)
        </p>
        <p class = 'img_des'>
            The T-shape silk painting (from wikipedia.)
        </p>
        <br>
        <img class = "img" src = imgs/T.png>
        <p class = "line">
            Since Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), clearer and more complete rules about ceremonies happening in important events were developed, resulting in a complicated system of rituals called chou-li (周禮.) One of the most important events is the death of people. 
            An particular ritual called fu (復) is usually performed as the first of a series of rituals for a newly dead. In fu, a summoner will face the north and call the name of the death out loudly. People believe that by doing so, the hun-soul of the death will return to his body. 
            In a famous excavated tomb built during Han dynasty called Ma-wang-dui (馬王堆漢墓), a T-shape silk painting is discovered, and there are clear depictions of summoners in this painting (in the white circle.)

            Another thing people noticed from the painting is that Chinese living in Han dynasty had also developed a relatively complete idea of the afterworld: the painting also describes the scene of the underworld, the rising spirit of the dead, and the heaven.
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            As mentioned above, fu is a ritual summoning the hun-soul of the dead, which leads to an important concept in the ancient Chinese notion developed during the second century B.C: the duality in the human soul which can be separated into hun-sould and p’o-soul. 
            A line in Li-Chi (禮記) can explain the difference between them: “The breath-soul (hun-chi魂氣) returns to heaven; the bodily soul(hsing-p’o形魄) returns to earth.”(Yu, 2016, P374)
        </p>
        <p class = "line"> 
            Briefly speaking, there’re two parts of life: a bodily part relying on food and water, and a spiritual part depending on an invisible heavenly force called "chi (氣)" - also considered as the “source of life”(Yu, 2016, P376.) Different parts of human soul govern different parts of human life: while p’o is in charge of the bodily part, hun governs the spiritual part, and will be closer to heaven.
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            This duality between human life and souls is also related to the traditional Taoist idea of Yin and Yang (陰 陽): hun represents the Yang/positive/masculine part of human life, while p’o represents the Yin/negative/feminine part of it. In fact, stuffs mentioned above - afterworld, duality of soul, chi, etc. - are all closely related to Taoism, thus the idea of Jiangshi can even be considered as an adapted product based on the Taoist idea.
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            After the death of human beings, two souls will leave the body and separate. P’o which is closely associated with the body will return to earth when the dead is buried. Hun, on the other hand, is much freer to move around, and will usually return to the afterworld - either hell or heaven. This also explains why it is hun but not p'o which is summoned in fu. 
        </p>
        <p class = 'img_des'>
            Taoist idea of Yin (black) and Yang (white) - Two basic constituents of the universe
        </p>

        <img class = "img" src = imgs/yinyang.png>
        <p class = "line">
            To conclude, ancient Chinese emphasize the death of human beings, and believe in the existance of afterlife, thus develop a complicated ritual system. They also believe in the dualistic conception of human soul, and Taoist idea of Yin-Yang also comes into play: comparing to p'o governing human body, hun is more heavenly and masculine (Yang), governs the spirit of human, and relates to "chi", the origin of life.
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            In next section about the origin, cause, kind, and characteristics of Jiangshi, word such as hun, p’o, chi will repeatedly appear, showing that those notions developed in the earliest time of Chinese civilization are preserved until Qing dynasty - a thousand years later.

            Another Important Legend: Corpse Driving in Xiangxi
        </h2>        
        <p class = "line">
            Besides Zibuyu, another tradition worth discussing which also leads to the inspiration of Hong Kong zombie films is a mysterious folk custom in mid-southern China called “Xiangxi Corpse-Drive” (湘西趕屍.) 
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            In traditional Chinese culture, there’s a notion saying “falling leaves return to roots”(落葉歸根.) In other words, people who died abroad want their bodies buried in their hometown. Therefore, there was the legend of a corpse driver using Taoist socery and a bell to make corpses jump by themselves and transport them back over thousands of miles to their hometown for a proper burial. 
        </p>
        <p class = 'img_des'>
            There're different kinds of fu-zhi, this one is used for home safety
        </p>
        <img class = "img" src = imgs/fu.jpg>
        <p class = "line">
            All corpses can only move in the night, a special Taoist talisman called fu-zhi(符紙/符籙) will be attached to their front head to avoid sudden frenzy and other accidents. Fu-zhi is usually written on special rectangular yellow paper, patterns on it are usually order and name of Taoist gods written in words. Different fu-zhi have different usages. 
            Some of it can be used to protect people from evils, others can drive spirits and ghosts, similar to the one attached to the front head of corpse. 
            If there is more than one corpse, they will be tied together by a straw rope. 
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            This tradition is never verified, but many of its characteristics are utilized, and appeared in Hong Kong Zombie films frequently. It is Hong Kong Zombie films that introduce it to the majority.

            Zombies' Origin -- <span: style = 'font-style: italic;'> What the Master Would not Discuss </span>
        </h2>
        <p class = "line">
            The figure of Hopping Zombie: a stiff corpse moving by only hopping, started to appear in strange tales of Qing dynasty, and Zibuyu, one of the most famous collections of strange tales - a genre of stories about supernatural beings including ghosts, monsters, and Jiangshi - discusses the kind, characteristics, reason of appearance, and weakness of Jiangshi in detail after collecting many pieces of information and folk tales.
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            A corpse, in order to turn into a Jiangshi/Hopping Zombie, need a procedure called Transformation(屍變.) There are multiple reasons leading to Transformation, but the most major one is “P'o souls moving after feeling Yang Chi”(感陽氣而走魄).
            There’re several stories mentioned Jiangshi, one of them in chapter five says explicitly:
        </p>
        <p class = "refline">
            狂奔里許，闖入酒店，大喊而仆，尸亦仆。酒家灌以姜湯，蘇，具道 其故。方知合村瘟疫，追人之尸，即病者之妻，死未棺殮，感陽氣而走魄也。村人共往尋沽酒者，亦持錢倒于橋側，離酒家尚五十余步。
        </p>
        <p class = "refline">
            The innkeeper fed him some ginger soup and Li regained consciousness. He told him everything that had happened. He then learned that an epidemic disease had swept across the whole village and that the corpse that had followed him was the sick man’s wife. She had died but had not yet been placed into a coffin. Recharged by the smell of yang, the living world, she was able to get up and move. The villagers went to look for the man who had gone to buy wine and found him collapsed beside the bridge, with the money still in his hand. He was only fifty steps away from the inn. (Yuan, p358.)
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            This story explains the reason for Transformation: recharged by the smell of yang, the living world. It uses a very interesting verb “recharged” in the English transferred version of the word gan(感) which literally means feel in Chinese. Those two verbs together describe the complete event leading to Transformation/reanimation of the corpse: when the body feels the positive chi coming from a living human, it is recharged and therefore reanimated. 
        </p>

        <p class = "line">
            This is consistent with the notion of human spirits discussed in the previous section. The reason of Transformation also logically makes sense: as mentioned before, it is Hun and P’o that compose a complete human soul, when a living human passing by a dead body, p’o which is still dwelling in it will feel the chi - the living force in Taoism idea - of that human, and it will be recharged by it, resulting in the final Transformation. P’o, is more closely related to the bodily part of human beings, will remain in the body after death, and is the Yin/negative part of the dual soul. Therefore, the existence of p’o also guarantees the ability of the corpse to move automatically after reanimation.
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            This paragraph also describes another important prerequisite that leads to Transformation: whether the body is buried properly. For example, this Jiangshi is Transformed because “she had died but not yet been placed into the coffin”. There are many other examples in Zibuyu saying that usually people who died but haven’t been buried(久死未殮) or buried in location with good geomany(風水) tend to become Jiangshi afterward.
        </p>
        <img class = "img" src = imgs/zibuyu.png>

        <p class = "line">
            Another reason described by Yuan is corpse-driving:			
        </p>
        <p class = "refline">
            次日，赴店買棺，店主人曰:“昨夜坐山虎死矣，我一方之害除矣， 汝仍以二千文原價來抬棺可也。” 問其故，主人曰:“此老姓洪，有妖法， 能役使鬼魅，慣遣死尸撲人。人死買棺，彼又在我店居奇，強分半價。”
        </p>
        <p class = "refline">
            The next day, Zhang returned to the shop to buy the coffin. The owner said: “‘Tiger in the Mountain’ died last night, therefore ridding our distinct of evil. You can buy the coffin at the original price of two thousand wen in coins.” Zhang asked what had happened and the owner said: “His last name was Hong and he had magic powers to make ghosts do things for him. He made them attack people. Whenever someone died and the family members came to buy a coffin, he would sit in my shop hoarding and profiteering and forcing me to share half the profits (Yuan, p560.) 
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            This reason seems to be consistent with the Xiangxi corpse-driving method mentioned above. Those two major reasons are frequently used in Hong Kong Zombie films to explain the appearance of Jiangshi, both imply Taoist idea deeply.
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            According to Yuan, there are many different kinds of Jiangshi, most are distinguished by different colors of hair growing on their bodies. For example, he says in chapter 2:
        </p>
        <p class = "refline">
            尸未消化而葬者，一得地氣，三月之後，遍體生毛，白者號白凶，黑者號黑凶， 便入人家為孽。 
        </p>
        <p class = "refline">
            The person wouldn’t be buried until his blood and flesh had melted, otherwise it was an ominous sign that something bad would happen. If someone were buried before his body had melted, the corpse would touch the ground as vapor and, within three months, be entirely covered in a layer of hair. The corpses with white hair were said to possess ‘white ominousness’ while the corpses with black hair were said to have ‘black ominousness’. They would go into people’s homes and haunt them. (P299)
        </p>
        <p class = "line">
            Most Jiangshi depends on their coffin, most of them tend to act at night - this is also explainable, since they have only negative p’o and are afraid of the sunlight - which is the most positive thing in the world burning out all evil beings according to Taoist idea. There are descriptions in Zibuyu saying that a Jiangshi turns into blood once it sees sunlight. Based on that, it is also afraid of fire and light. It is also afraid of rice, rooster's crow, and any damage done to its coffin. On the other hand, they hunt human beings and crave human flesh because of the living force/chi in living human’s body. Those characteristics become settings in Hong Kong zombie films.
